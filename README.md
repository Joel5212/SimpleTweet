## Notes

One challenge I had was the app showing up as blank screen the first time I ran it. I later realized that I didn't have any content in my Home timeline in twitter so I followed a few twitter accounts and the contents showed up on my app.

# Project 2 (Part 2) - SimpleTweet

SimpleTweet is an android app that allows a user to view his Twitter timeline and post a new tweet. The app utilizes [Twitter REST API](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public).

Time spent: 8 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] User can **compose and post a new tweet**
  - [X] User can click a “Compose” icon in the Action Bar on the top right
  - [X] User can then enter a new tweet and post this to twitter
  - [X] User is taken back to home timeline with **new tweet visible** in timeline
  - [X] Newly created tweet should be manually inserted into the timeline and not rely on a full refresh
  - [X] User can **see a counter with total number of characters left for tweet** on compose tweet page

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] User is using **"Twitter branded" colors and styles**
- [ ] User can click links in tweets launch the web browser 
- [ ] User can **select "reply" from detail view to respond to a tweet**
- [ ] The "Compose" action is moved to a FloatingActionButton instead of on the AppBar
- [ ] Compose tweet functionality is build using modal overlay
- [X] Use Parcelable instead of Serializable using the popular [Parceler library](http://guides.codepath.org/android/Using-Parceler).
- [ ] User can **open the twitter app offline and see last loaded tweets**. Persisted in SQLite tweets are refreshed on every application launch. While "live data" is displayed when app can get it from Twitter API, it is also saved for use in offline mode.
- [ ] When a user leaves the compose view without publishing and there is existing text, prompt to save or delete the draft. If saved, the draft should then be **persisted to disk** and can later be resumed from the compose view.
- [ ] Enable your app to receive implicit intents from other apps. When a link is shared from a web browser, it should pre-fill the text and title of the web page when composing a tweet. 

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
- Implemented black background
- Implemented blue capsule shaped twitter button
- Tweet counter is gray until 260 characters, then turns yellow until 280 characters, and then turns red showing that the maximum character limit has been passed.

## Notes

One challenge I faced was implementing the tweet count and it took me a long time to figure out how to create it. By carefully reading the documents on the methods I need to use and by using my Java knowledge I was able to implement it sucessfully.
